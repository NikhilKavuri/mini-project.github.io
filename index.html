        <h1>BMW X6 delisted from official website</h1><br>
        <p class="bmw-info">BMW India has removed the X6 SUV from its India website. The X6 which <br>was slotted above the X5 was offered only with a petrol powertrain across<br> three trims – xLine, M Sport, and 50 Jahre M Edition. 
        The discontinuation <br> of the BMW X6 comes soon after its younger brethren, the X4 was delisted <br> from the brand’s website. Both the SUVs were produced locally at the <br> brand’s Chennai plant and boasted a sloping coupe-type roofline. The X6 <br> made use of a 3.0-litre six-cylinder petrol engine which develops 335bhp and<br> 450Nm of torque and was paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission. </p>
